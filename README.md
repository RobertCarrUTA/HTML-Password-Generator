## About the Project
HTML and JavaScript were used to create this password generator. Passwords can range from 8 to 256 characters in length and can include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. With one click, the user can copy the password directly to their clipboard with the password generator's clipboard feature.

Due to the frequency with which I create new passwords or change passwords, I created this project. I decided to make my own password generator because I no longer have access to the one I previously used. Password-generating websites are available elsewhere, but they are too distracting. It was important to me that this tool would generate passwords without distraction. The user interface should be simple and uncluttered with no advertisements. There is no distraction; you are directed exactly to the place you need to be looking.

## Compile Instructions

* Download or copy index.html and open the file from the file explorer.
